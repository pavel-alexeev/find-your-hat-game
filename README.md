 # 'Find Your Hat' game
 
 ### This game was created as part of a challange project in Codecademy Front-End Developer career path course.
 
 To launch the game you have to press 'Enter' button. Then programm asks you to enter field width and height. Also you have an option to choose how many percent of the field you want to be covered with holes. If you want more difficult game, then you have to choose higher percentage of holes. Our advise is to choose betwen 20 and 30% of the field to be covered with holes. This will makes your experience more interesting. We do not recommend to set holes amout to be above 50% of the field, as this will makes your experience very challanging and nearly impossible to complete. 
 
Field contains - one hat (you have to reach it to win the game), holes, path and field itself. Enjoy the game. Any feedback will be much appreciated. Thank you for your time. Enjoy!
